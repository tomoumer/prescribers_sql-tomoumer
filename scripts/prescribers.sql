-- 3b. Which drug (generic_name) has the hightest total cost per day? **Bonus: Round your cost per day column to 2 decimal places. Google ROUND to see how this works.**
-- a: BEXAROTENE, 901.86 / day

-- 7. The goal of this exercise is to generate a full list of all pain management specialists in Nashville and the number of claims they had for each opioid. **Hint:** The results from all 3 parts will have 637 rows.

-- 7a. First, create a list of all npi/drug_name combinations for pain management specialists (specialty_description = 'Pain Management') in the city of Nashville (nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'), where the drug is an opioid (opiod_drug_flag = 'Y'). **Warning:** Double-check your query before running it. You will only need to use the prescriber and drug tables since you don't need the claims numbers yet.

-- SELECT
-- 	npi,
-- 	drug_name
-- FROM prescriber p1
-- CROSS JOIN drug d
-- WHERE specialty_description = 'Pain Management'
-- 	AND nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'
-- 	AND opioid_drug_flag = 'Y';


-- 7b. Next, report the number of claims per drug per prescriber. Be sure to include all combinations, whether or not the prescriber had any claims. You should report the npi, the drug name, and the number of claims (total_claim_count).

-- SELECT p1.npi,
-- 		d.drug_name,
-- 		SUM(total_claim_count)
-- FROM prescriber p1
-- CROSS JOIN drug d

-- 	AND nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'
-- 	AND opioid_drug_flag = 'Y'
-- GROUP BY p1.npi, d.drug_name;

-- 7c. Finally, if you have not done so already, fill in any missing values for total_claim_count with 0. Hint - Google the COALESCE function.
-- NOTE: the SUM that I used is actually superfluous given how the table is constructed!

-- SELECT p1.npi,

-- 	AND opioid_drug_flag = 'Y'
-- GROUP BY p1.npi, d.drug_name;

-- ====== PART 2

-- 1. How many npi numbers appear in the prescriber table but not in the prescription table?
-- a: 4458

-- SELECT
--	COUNT(npi)
-- FROM prescriber
-- WHERE npi NOT IN
-- 	(SELECT DISTINCT npi
-- 	FROM prescription); 

-- 2a. Find the top five drugs (generic_name) prescribed by prescribers with the specialty of Family Practice.

-- SELECT
--	generic_name,
--	SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
-- FROM prescriber p1
-- LEFT JOIN prescription p2
-- ON p1.npi = p2.npi
-- LEFT JOIN drug d

-- WHERE specialty_description = 'Family Practice'
-- 	AND generic_name IS NOT NULL
-- GROUP BY d.generic_name
-- ORDER BY total_claims DESC
-- LIMIT 5;

-- 2b. Find the top five drugs (generic_name) prescribed by prescribers with the specialty of Cardiology.

-- SELECT
--	generic_name,
--	SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
-- FROM prescriber p1
-- LEFT JOIN prescription p2
-- ON p1.npi = p2.npi
-- LEFT JOIN drug d

-- WHERE specialty_description = 'Cardiology'
-- 	AND generic_name IS NOT NULL
-- GROUP BY d.generic_name
-- ORDER BY total_claims DESC
-- LIMIT 5;

-- 2c. Which drugs appear in the top five prescribed for both Family Practice prescribers and Cardiologists? Combine what you did for parts a and b into a single query to answer this question.
-- a: ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM and AMLODIPINE BESYLATE

-- (SELECT generic_name
-- FROM prescriber p1
-- LEFT JOIN prescription p2
-- ON p1.npi = p2.npi
-- LEFT JOIN drug d
-- ON p2.drug_name = d.drug_name
-- WHERE specialty_description = 'Family Practice'
-- 	AND generic_name IS NOT NULL
-- GROUP BY d.generic_name
-- ORDER BY SUM(total_claim_count) DESC
-- LIMIT 5)
-- INTERSECT
-- (SELECT generic_name
-- FROM prescriber p1
-- LEFT JOIN prescription p2

-- WHERE specialty_description = 'Cardiology'
-- 	AND generic_name IS NOT NULL
-- GROUP BY d.generic_name
-- ORDER BY SUM(total_claim_count) DESC
-- LIMIT 5);

-- 3. Your goal in this question is to generate a list of the top prescribers in each of the major metropolitan areas of Tennessee.
-- 3a. First, write a query that finds the top 5 prescribers in Nashville in terms of the total number of claims (total_claim_count) across all drugs. Report the npi, the total number of claims, and include a column showing the city.

-- SELECT
--	npi,
-- 	nppes_provider_city,
-- 	SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
-- FROM prescriber AS p1
-- INNER JOIN prescription AS p2
-- USING(npi)
-- WHERE nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'
-- GROUP BY npi, nppes_provider_city
-- ORDER BY total_claims DESC
-- LIMIT 5;

-- 3b. Now, report the same for Memphis.

-- SELECT 
--	npi,
-- 	nppes_provider_city,
-- 	SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
-- FROM prescriber AS p1
-- INNER JOIN prescription AS p2
-- USING(npi)
-- WHERE nppes_provider_city = 'MEMPHIS'
-- GROUP BY npi, nppes_provider_city
-- ORDER BY total_claims DESC
-- LIMIT 5;

-- 3c. Combine your results from a and b, along with the results for Knoxville and Chattanooga.

-- (SELECT npi,
-- 	nppes_provider_city,
-- 	SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
-- FROM prescriber AS p1
-- INNER JOIN prescription AS p2
-- USING(npi)
-- WHERE nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'
-- GROUP BY npi, nppes_provider_city
-- ORDER BY total_claims DESC
-- LIMIT 5)
-- UNION
-- (SELECT npi,
-- 	nppes_provider_city,
-- 	SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
-- FROM prescriber AS p1
-- INNER JOIN prescription AS p2
-- USING(npi)
-- WHERE nppes_provider_city = 'MEMPHIS'
-- GROUP BY npi, nppes_provider_city
-- ORDER BY total_claims DESC
-- LIMIT 5)
-- UNION
-- (SELECT npi,
-- 	nppes_provider_city,
-- 	SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
-- FROM prescriber AS p1
-- INNER JOIN prescription AS p2
-- USING(npi)
-- WHERE nppes_provider_city = 'KNOXVILLE'
-- GROUP BY npi, nppes_provider_city
-- ORDER BY total_claims DESC
-- LIMIT 5)
-- UNION
-- (SELECT npi,
-- 	nppes_provider_city,
-- 	SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
-- FROM prescriber AS p1
-- INNER JOIN prescription AS p2
-- USING(npi)
-- WHERE nppes_provider_city = 'CHATTANOOGA'
-- GROUP BY npi, nppes_provider_city
-- ORDER BY total_claims DESC
-- LIMIT 5)

-- 4. Find all counties which had an above-average (for the state) number of overdose deaths in 2017. Report the county name and number of overdose deaths.
-- (note: table was originally missing - Michael sent it to me as a .csv to add)

-- SELECT
-- 	od.overdose_deaths, 
-- 	fp.county
-- FROM overdose_deaths AS od
-- LEFT JOIN fips_county AS fp
-- USING(fipscounty)
-- WHERE year = 2017
-- 	AND overdose_deaths > (SELECT AVG(overdose_deaths)
-- 							FROM overdose_deaths
-- 							WHERE year=2017);

--5a. Write a query that finds the total population of Tennessee.

-- SELECT SUM(population)
-- FROM population

--5b. Build off of the query that you wrote in part a to write a query that returns for each county that county's name, its population, and the percentage of the total population of Tennessee that is contained in that county.

-- SELECT
-- 	county,
-- 	population,
-- 	ROUND(100.0 * population / (SELECT SUM(population) FROM population),2) AS perc_population 
-- FROM population
-- LEFT JOIN fips_county
-- USING(fipscounty)
-- ORDER BY perc_population DESC


-- ====== Bonus Grouping Sets

-- 1. Write a query which returns the total number of claims for these two groups (Interventional Pain Management & Pain Management).

-- SELECT
-- 	specialty_description,
-- 	SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
-- FROM prescriber
-- INNER JOIN prescription
-- USING(npi)
-- WHERE specialty_description IN ('Interventional Pain Management', 'Pain Management')
-- GROUP BY specialty_description


-- 2. Now, let's say that we want our output to also include the total number of claims between these two groups. Combine two queries with the UNION keyword to accomplish this.

-- (SELECT
--  Null AS specialty_description,
--  SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
-- FROM prescriber
-- INNER JOIN prescription
-- USING(npi)
-- WHERE specialty_description IN ('Interventional Pain Management', 'Pain Management')
-- )
-- UNION
-- (SELECT
-- 	specialty_description,
-- 	SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
-- FROM prescriber
-- INNER JOIN prescription
-- USING(npi)
-- WHERE specialty_description IN ('Interventional Pain Management', 'Pain Management')
-- GROUP BY specialty_description);

-- 3. Now, instead of using UNION, make use of GROUPING SETS (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-GROUPING-SETS) to achieve the same output.

-- SELECT
-- 	specialty_description,
-- 	SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
-- FROM prescriber
-- INNER JOIN prescription
-- USING(npi)
-- WHERE specialty_description IN ('Interventional Pain Management', 'Pain Management')
-- GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((specialty_description), ());
